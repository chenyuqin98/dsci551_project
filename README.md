# Background and Description
As the leading animal welfare platform in Malaysia, PetFinder.my has been maintaining a database of over 15000 animals. Recently, It is experimenting with AI tools to help homeless pets find people who are willing to adopt them. This project is yet another endeavor in the wave. As it is arguably true that animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to their online profiles,  this project aims to solve an analytics problem: Make a prediction of how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted, given a fair amount of profile data consisting of both text data and non-text data.
